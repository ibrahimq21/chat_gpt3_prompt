**Human:**
is there any mention on the time of implementation of the mini budget 

***

**Assistant:**

I'm sorry, but I couldn't find any specific mention of the time of implementation of the mini-budget in the Budget Speech for the fiscal year 2022-2023. It appears that the budget presented by the government is a full-year budget, rather than a mini-budget.

In general, when a mini-budget is announced in Pakistan, it is usually implemented soon after its announcement, typically within a few weeks or a month. However, as there is no mention of a mini-budget in the Budget Speech for the fiscal year 2022-2023, it is unclear if and when a mini-budget may be announced and implemented in the future.
